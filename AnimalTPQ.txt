1. How many hierarchies do you have? Why?
Just one, the base animal is the parent, and the predator
and prey classes are the children. I did this since it made
logical sense to me, predators and prey are both animals,
("is a" relationship) but not all animalsa are predators,
and vice versa.


2. How many classes are in the hierarchy(ies)? 
How many levels does this hierarchy(ies) have?

3 classes, the baseAnimal class, the prey class
and the predator class. 

the hiearchy has 2 levels I think.

3. What members did you make protected? Private?

I made everything private except getters and setters
and special functions as needed, since I think its good
practice to have the default be private for member vars. 


4. What kind of inheritance mode(s) did you use for your inheritance?

class Child : public Parent

I did it this way since the children uses alot of data from the
parent's member vars (like speed). 


5. Have you used any composition? 
 Or is your entire program dependant on inheritance?

My entire program is dependant on inheritance


6. How many arrays do you have to
 hold your simulation's population? How 'weildy' is this?

I have two arrays, one for predators and one for prey. 
I think its pretty weildy for this application.


7. What sort of initial counts cause predators to reign? Prey? 
 A stable population (not by code -- by inspection)?

If there's prey>>predators, then predators reign, and vice versa.

a Stable population would most likely have slighly more prey 
then predators but not so much that the predators pop balloons.
